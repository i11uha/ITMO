# 🧪 Laboratory Assignments — ITMO University  
**Author:** Ilya Safin

This is my personal archive of lab work from courses in programming, office software fundamentals, and other subjects. It contains code, reports, and occasionally task descriptions — basically everything I wrote myself and didn’t want to lose. Think of it as a backup with context, so I can actually remember how I solved something.

### What’s inside?
- 📁 Folders organized by course and topic  
- 💻 Working (or mostly working) code in Python, Java, and occasional shell scripts  
- 📝 Reports, annotations, or explanations — wherever they were required  
- 📄 Original assignment descriptions — when I still have them

### Can you copy it?
**No.**  
This is a record of *my* learning process — not a ready-made solution to submit. If you find an idea useful, great! But you still need to write your own implementation. Passing off someone else’s work as your own is a bad idea in general, and especially at ITMO.

If you do borrow inspiration or reference something here (for study notes, projects, etc.), please credit the source. Integrity matters more than convenience.
